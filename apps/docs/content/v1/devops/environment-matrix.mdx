| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Purpose | Development speed | Pre-release validation | Customer traffic |
| Data | Synthetic + disposable | Production-like snapshots | Real customer data |
| Auth secrets | Local `.env` | Managed secrets | Managed secrets + rotation |
| Observability | Basic logs | Full metrics/traces | Full metrics/traces + SLO alerts |
| Scaling | Single instance | Horizontal baseline | Autoscaled by demand |
| Change cadence | Continuous | Daily | Controlled rollout windows |

<Callout title="Rule" tone="warning">
  Never assume local defaults are safe for production. Use explicit environment overrides and secret management.
