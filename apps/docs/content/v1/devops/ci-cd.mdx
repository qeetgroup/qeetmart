## Current pipeline responsibilities

- Path-aware Node build/test for gateway + web/admin + docs
- Spring Boot test matrix for auth/user/product
- Go tests for inventory
- OpenAPI lint and breaking change detection
- Helm and Kustomize validation

## Docs quality gates

- Frontmatter validation
- Drift checks (env variables and OpenAPI sync)
- Search index generation validity
- Next.js production build of `apps/docs`

## Policy

- PRs that modify services must update corresponding docs when behavior changes.
- Breaking API changes require version strategy update (`v2` docs path).
