## Contribution standards

- Keep docs and code changes in the same PR.
- Use concrete commands, not abstract instructions.
- Document environment variables and defaults for every new service/config.
- Add or update runbooks for operationally meaningful behavior changes.

## Required PR checklist

- [ ] Updated docs pages for behavior changes
- [ ] Updated OpenAPI contract if API changed
- [ ] Ran docs drift and content validation
- [ ] Confirmed links and commands are correct

## Useful commands

```bash
pnpm --filter docs dev
pnpm --filter docs check:content
pnpm --filter docs check:drift
pnpm --filter docs build
```

## Ownership model

- `platform`: docs structure, automation scripts, CI gates
- `identity`: auth/user docs and API references
- `catalog`: product docs and API references
- `fulfillment`: inventory docs and runbooks
