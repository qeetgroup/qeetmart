## Standard daily loop

1. Pull latest `main` and install dependencies.
2. Start local stack (`pnpm docker:up`).
3. Run the service you are editing in dev mode if needed.
4. Validate contracts, unit tests, and affected app builds.
5. Update docs as part of the same PR.

## Typical command set

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm docker:up
pnpm contracts:lint
pnpm contracts:breaking
pnpm build
```

## Service-specific tests

```bash
pnpm test:auth-service
pnpm test:user-service
pnpm test:product-service
pnpm test:inventory-service
```

## Definition of done

- Code and docs updated together
- OpenAPI changes validated and non-breaking unless version bump is intentional
- CI passes for Node/Java/Go + contracts + docs
