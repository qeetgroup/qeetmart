<Callout title="Success criteria" tone="success">
  You are done when `pnpm smoke:local` returns healthy checks for gateway, auth, user, product, and inventory.
</Callout>

## Before you run commands

- Use a clean branch with no uncommitted infra changes.
- Keep Docker Desktop running before step 3.
- Stay in repo root (`qeetmart/`) for all commands.

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Install dependencies">

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Expected outcome: workspace dependencies resolve without lockfile changes.

  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Create environment files">

```bash
cp micros/api-gateway/.env.example micros/api-gateway/.env
cp micros/auth-service/.env.example micros/auth-service/.env
cp micros/user-service/.env.example micros/user-service/.env
cp micros/product-service/.env.example micros/product-service/.env
cp micros/inventory-service/.env.example micros/inventory-service/.env
```

Expected outcome: each service now has a local `.env` file.

  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Start infrastructure and services via Docker">

```bash
pnpm docker:up
```

Expected outcome: all containers show `healthy` in compose status.

  </Step>
  <Step title="4. Validate API contracts and smoke endpoints">

```bash
pnpm contracts:lint
pnpm contracts:breaking
curl http://localhost:4000/health
curl http://localhost:4000/health/services
```

Expected outcome: contract checks pass and health endpoints return `200`.

  </Step>
  <Step title="5. Start frontend apps (optional during first run)">

```bash
pnpm dev:web
pnpm dev:admin
```

Expected outcome: web/admin apps boot without gateway CORS or auth handshake errors.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## First-day checklist

- [ ] Gateway reachable at `http://localhost:4000`
- [ ] Auth service reachable at `http://localhost:8081/actuator/health`
- [ ] User service reachable at `http://localhost:8082/actuator/health`
- [ ] Product service reachable at `http://localhost:8083/actuator/health`
- [ ] Inventory service reachable at `http://localhost:8080/health`
- [ ] OpenAPI contracts lint clean

## If startup fails

<Callout title="Startup takes longer than 15 minutes" tone="warning">
  Go to <a href="/docs/v1/runbooks/common-incidents">Common Incidents</a> and run the "Docker service fails healthcheck" flow.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Gateway returns 502" tone="critical">
  Validate `AUTH_SERVICE_URL`, `USER_SERVICE_URL`, `PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL`, and `INVENTORY_SERVICE_URL` in `micros/api-gateway/.env`.
</Callout>
