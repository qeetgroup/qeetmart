The system is a polyglot microservices platform centered on a Node.js API gateway. Each service owns its data model and exposes HTTP APIs documented in OpenAPI.

## Layer 1: System topology

## Layer 2: Why this shape

- Gateway is the only public API entrypoint.
- Services own persistence and business rules.
- OpenAPI contracts are versioned and CI-governed.
- Local development mirrors production topology with Docker.

## Key boundaries

- Identity and tokens: auth-service
- User profile data: user-service
- Catalog/product metadata: product-service
- Stock and reservations: inventory-service

## Layer 3: Read this when debugging incidents

- If gateway health is green but APIs fail, inspect downstream service health first.
- If one service is degraded, treat its database and cache dependencies as the next fault domain.
- Use dependency graph + runbooks together: topology tells you where to look, runbooks tell you what to run.
