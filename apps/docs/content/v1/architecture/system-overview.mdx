The system is a polyglot microservices platform centered on a Node.js API gateway. Each service owns its data model and exposes HTTP APIs documented in OpenAPI.

## Architecture principles

- Gateway is the only public API entrypoint.
- Services own persistence and business rules.
- OpenAPI contracts are versioned and CI-governed.
- Local development mirrors production topology with Docker.

## Key boundaries

- Identity and tokens: auth-service
- User profile data: user-service
- Catalog/product metadata: product-service
- Stock and reservations: inventory-service
