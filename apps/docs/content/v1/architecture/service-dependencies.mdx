## Dependency model

## Coupling constraints

- Service-to-service calls are intentionally minimized.
- Token verification is shared via JWT issuer and secret agreement.
- Contract evolution is managed through `contracts/openapi/*` checks.

## Failure behavior

- If a downstream service is unavailable, gateway returns `502`.
- Health fanout endpoint exposes per-service status.
- Rate limiter protects downstream services during incident spikes.
