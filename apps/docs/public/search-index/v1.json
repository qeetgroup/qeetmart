Failures usually propagate along arrow direction. Coupling constraints - Service-to-service calls are intentionally minimized. - Token verification is shared via JWT issuer and secret agreement. - Contract evolution is managed through contracts/openapi/ checks. Failure behavior - If a downstream service is unavailable, gateway returns 502 . - Health fanout endpoint exposes per-service status. - Rate limiter protects downstream services during incident spikes. Practical debugging sequence 1. Start at the failing client flow and identify the gateway route. 2. Follow one edge at a time to the next dependency. 3. Verify health and logs for each dependency before jumping services."

    "body": "This page is generated by pnpm --filter docs sync:readmes . Qeetmart API Gateway API Gateway for the Qeetmart microservices architecture. This gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests and routes them to the appropriate microservices. Features - Request Routing : Routes requests to appropriate microservices based on URL patterns - Service Discovery : Configurable service registry with health checks - Authentication : Token forwarding and validation middleware - Rate Limiting : Protects services from overload - Request Logging : Comprehensive logging with correlation IDs - Health Monitoring : Health check endpoints for gateway and services - Error Handling : Centralized error handling and service failure management Tech Stack - Express.js - Web framework - TypeScript - Type safety - http-proxy-middleware - Request proxying - Helmet - Security headers - CORS - Cross-origin resource sharing - express-rate-limit - Rate limiting Architecture Setup 1. Install dependencies: 2. Set up environment variables: 3. Start the gateway: The gateway will be available at http://localhost:4000 Configuration Service URLs By default, services are expected at: - Auth Service: http://localhost:8081 - User Service: http://localhost:8082 - Product Service: http://localhost:8083 - Order Service: http://localhost:8084 - Payment Service: http://localhost:8085 - Inventory Service: http://localhost:8080 Override these in .env : JWT validation settings: Route Configuration Routes are configured in src/config/services.ts . The gateway routes: - /api/v1/auth/ → Auth Service - /api/v1/users/ → User Service - /api/v1/products/ → Product Service - /api/v1/orders/ → Order Service - /api/v1/payments/ → Payment Service - /api/v1/inventory/ → Inventory Service API Endpoints Gateway Endpoints - GET /health - Gateway health check - GET /health/services - Health status of all registered services - GET /info - Gateway information and registered services Proxied Endpoints All requests to /api/v1/ are proxied to the appropriate microservice. Example: Middleware Authentication Middleware The gateway includes authentication middleware that: - Extracts JWT tokens from Authorization headers - Validates JWT signature and claims (issuer/expiration/audience) - Forwards verified tokens to downstream services - Allows public endpoints (health, info, register, login, refresh-token) Logging Middleware All requests are logged with: - Correlation ID (auto-generated or from X-Correlation-ID header) - Request method and path - Response status and duration - Client IP and user agent Rate Limiting Rate limiting is applied to all /api/ routes: - 1000 requests per minute per IP (configurable) - Prevents service overload Health Checks Gateway Health Response: Service Health Response: Error Handling The gateway handles various error scenarios: - Service Unavailable (502) : When a downstream service is unreachable - Timeout : When a service doesn't respond within the configured timeout - Not Found (404) : When a route doesn't match any service - Rate Limit (429) : When rate limit is exceeded Development Project Structure Adding a New Service 1. Add service configuration to src/config/services.ts : 2. Add route configuration: 3. Add environment variable to .env.example : Production Considerations - Service Discovery : Consider using Consul, Eureka, or Kubernetes service discovery - Load Balancing : Add load balancing for multiple service instances - Circuit Breaker : Implement circuit breaker pattern for resilience - Caching : Add response caching for frequently accessed endpoints - Monitoring : Integrate with Prometheus/Grafana for metrics - Tracing : Add distributed tracing (Jaeger, Zipkin) - SSL/TLS : Use HTTPS in production - Authentication : Rotate JWT secrets and enforce issuer/audience claims Troubleshooting Service Not Responding 1. Check if service is running: 2. Check gateway logs for errors 3. Verify service URL in .env matches actual service URL CORS Issues Update CORS ORIGIN in .env to match your frontend URL. Rate Limiting Issues Adjust rate limit configuration in src/index.ts : License MIT"
